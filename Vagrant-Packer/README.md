Instructions for Assignment1
========================================

After installing the required tools, you will need to ensure that your computer can find the executables to run them. For this, you might need to modify the PATH environment variable. A good overview is at [superuser.com](https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them). You may need to search the web for instructions on how to set the PATH variable for your specific operating system and version. 

## Setting up your local machine

* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html)

## Part I: Building a box with Packer

From the packer-templates directory on your local machine:

* Run `packer build -only=virtualbox-iso application-server.json`. You may see various timeouts and errors, as shown below. If you do, read Troubleshooting or retry the command until the ISO download succeeds:

```
read: operation timed out
==> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
Build 'virtualbox-iso' errored: ISO download failed.

checksums didn't match expected
==> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
Build 'virtualbox-iso' errored: ISO download failed.

==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
--> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
```

* Run `cd virtualbox`
* Run `vagrant box add debian-9.2.1-i386-netinst-appserver_virtualbox.box --name devops-appserver`
* Run `vagrant up`
* Run `vagrant ssh` to connect to the server


## Part II: Cloning, developing, and running the web application

* On your virtual-ghost machine run `git clone https://github.com/chef/devops-kungfu.git devops-kungfu`
* Open http://localhost:8080 from your host-machine browse to see the app running.
* In the VM, run `cd devops-kungfu`
* To install app specific node packages, run `sudo npm install`. You may see several errors; they can be ignored for now.
* Now you can run tests with the command `grunt -v`. The tests will run, then quit with an error.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors with Debian version numbers not being available or checksum errors on Debian,it means that this repository has not yet been updated for the latest Debian version. Meanwhile, you can fix this error for yourself by editing the contents of the `application-server.json` and `control-server.json` template files inside the `packer-templates` folder.

* Find the newest version number and checksum from the [Debian website for this release](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/)
* Edit `PACKER_BOX_NAME` and `iso_checksum` in the template files to match that version number and checksum.
